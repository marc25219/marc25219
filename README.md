# Hello, folks! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px" height="30px" />

My name is Marc Ciruelos Santos and I'm a Computer Engineering student at the Open University of Catalonia (UOC). 

âš™ Currently, I work as a QA Lead and Test Automation Engineer in Barcelona.

ðŸ’» When I'm not busy with work or school, you can find me exploring the exciting world of Java and MySQL on the backend.

ðŸ“• Finally, my skills include designing and executing automated tests, analyzing test results, and leading a team. 

ðŸ“‘ Check out my repositories for some of my latest projects. Feel free to reach out to me if you'd like to learn more about me or my experiences!
